# Password Generator

A macOS password generator is a AppKit app that can generate random, secure passwords. It allows users to specify the length and complexity of the generated password, and also include features such as the ability to exclude certain characters or include special characters. The generated passwords can be copied to the clipboard and used to protect the user's sensitive information from unauthorized access.
